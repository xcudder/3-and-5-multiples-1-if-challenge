The challenge was:
Using SOLID principles, write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Three". For multiples of 5 print "Five". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "ThreeAndFive".
The catch was: you can use only one 'if'. No multiple branches, ternay operators or 'else'.
